### In this Notebook, we will implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to classify malaria infected blood cells. It is a supervised classification problem, with two classes : uninfected and parasitized.
The Dataset is an Open Dataset, that you can find on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
